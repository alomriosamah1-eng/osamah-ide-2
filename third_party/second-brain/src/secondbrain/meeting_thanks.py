"""Polish v3 round 8 — auto-generate thank-you emails after coffee
chats / 1:1s / external meetings.

Pipeline mirrors the round-6/7 email drafter, but starts from a
calendar event instead of an inbox email:

  1. **Detect**: poll calendar for events that ended in the last
     ~48h with at least one external attendee. Each gets a row in
     ``meeting_thanks`` with status='pending_context'.
  2. **Match transcript**: look for transcript:// docs whose mtime
     is near the event end + whose title overlaps the event title.
     When found → status='ready' and the transcript becomes the
     draft's context.
  3. **Generate**: when ready (transcript found OR user supplied
     context via CLI/dashboard), call the thank-you drafter. Reuses
     the same voice profile + reply-pair few-shot from email_assist
     so the thank-you sounds like the user. Output lands in
     ``email_drafts`` so it shows up in the existing /drafts UI
     alongside reply drafts.
  4. **User reviews + sends** through the same /drafts surface.
     Marking sent flips the meeting_thanks row to 'sent' too.

Skip rules: pure-internal meetings (everyone @user-domain), known
recurring patterns ("standup", "1:1"-with-direct-report, "weekly
sync") get auto-marked skipped on detection. The user can override
via the CLI.

Cost: thank-you drafts share the email_assist budget bucket so
they show up in the same per-feature spend cap.

# ---- Drafter --------------------------------------------------------

# Round-8 thank-you prompt — same JSON-shaped output as the round-6
# drafter so the existing /drafts UI hydrates without changes. Note
# the explicit "do NOT invent specifics" rule + the fallback to a
# generic-but-warm thank-you when context is thin.
_THANKS_PROMPT = """\
Write a thank-you email from {user_name} after a meeting. Output ONE
JSON object (no prose, no Markdown fences):

{{
  "primary": "<the thank-you body — no subject line, no quote block>",
  "alternative": "<a SECOND version with a different tone register (formal vs casual swap)>",
  "reasoning": "<1-3 sentences on the choices made>",
  "confidence": <float 0.0..1.0>,
  "open_questions": ["<things {user_name} must fill in before sending>"]
}}

THANK-YOU RULES — this is the entire reason this email exists
==============
- The PRIMARY job is to make the recipient feel seen. Reference 1-2
  SPECIFIC things from the meeting context — a topic discussed, a
  question they answered, an interest they shared. Generic
  "thanks for chatting" thank-yous are worse than not sending one.
- Keep it SHORT. 3-5 sentences for casual coffee chats; up to a
  paragraph for formal interviews. Anything longer feels obligated.
- Restate any commitments you made ("I'll send the link", "I'll
  intro you to X"). If you forgot what you committed to, use a
  ``<TODO: confirm what I said I'd do>`` placeholder.
- Voice fidelity is paramount — match {user_name}'s greeting +
  sign-off + sentence rhythm exactly as observed in the voice
  profile. NEVER use any phrase listed in "avoid these phrases".
- For unknowns (specific dates, deliverables, names from the
  conversation), use ``<TODO: brief description>`` placeholders
  inline. Do NOT invent specifics.
- The ALTERNATIVE flips the tone register — if the primary is
  warm-casual, the alternative is more formal-restrained, or
  vice-versa. Lets the user pick which voice fits.

VOICE PROFILE — match these patterns
