"""Round 16 (Phase B) — proactive weekly review as a personal letter.

The pre-existing ``synthesis.py`` weekly review is a stats dump (counts,
top entities, lingering tasks) rendered as bullet lists. This module
upgrades that into an actual *letter* — a short, personal, narrative
synthesis written by Claude Sonnet that:

  - References specific events from the week (not generic affirmations).
  - Notices cross-source patterns (journal mood vs sleep, tasks vs
    health, recurring themes across emails / meetings / files).
  - Surfaces open threads — things you mentioned but didn't resolve.
  - Calls back to the prior letter for continuity.
  - Ends with one specific, actionable suggestion (not a long list).

Design notes:

  - Sonnet (not Haiku) — quality matters. ~$0.05 / week is fine.
  - Single LLM call. Multi-step would over-engineer for marginal gain.
  - Heavy prompt engineering: anti-pattern instructions explicit.
  - Stats-only fallback when Anthropic is unavailable so the daemon
    never produces nothing on a Sunday.
  - Per-week idempotency via UNIQUE(week_end). Re-running on the same
    Sunday no-ops; ``--regenerate`` flips it.
  - Prior letter is included for context so successive weeks build on
    each other (the model can say "you mentioned wanting X last week —
    you started it Tuesday").

Privacy:

  - Journal text is the highest-signal input but also the most personal.
    We pass it through ``redact_text`` (masks API keys / SSNs /
    credit cards) but NOT through truncation-style ``_safe_for_prompt``
    truncation — losing personal context would crater the letter
    quality. Sending personal thoughts to Anthropic is the whole
    premise of the system; the user opted in.
  - Email subjects/snippets, meeting transcripts, and tasks all go
    through ``redact_text``.
  - The full letter is stored in the local DB; the signals_json
    snapshot is also stored so we can audit what was sent.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing a weekly personal letter to the user. Your voice is warm, observant, and honest — like a smart friend who has been paying attention. Not corporate, not therapy-speak, not motivational-poster.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Total length under 700 words.
- Be specific. Cite actual numbers, names (first-name only), and events from the data.
- Notice patterns ACROSS signals (e.g., "your journal mentions 'tired' on the same days your sleep score dropped"). If there are no real patterns, say so plainly — "nothing stood out across signals this week" — instead of inventing one.
- Do NOT compliment without evidence. "Great work this week!" without specifics is hollow.
- Do NOT recommend without specific data. "Try journaling more" is generic; "you skipped journal Thu/Fri — was something off those days?" is specific.
- ONE concrete suggestion at the end, not a list.
- Avoid these words and phrases entirely: "amazing", "journey", "incredible", "powerful", "transformative", "unleash", "elevate", "synergy", "leverage" (as a verb), "deep dive", "level up", emoji.
- Never start a sentence with "I noticed that you" — too clinical. Just say what you noticed.
- If the data is sparse (a quiet week), write a short letter (2-3 paragraphs) acknowledging that. Don't pad.

STRUCTURE:
1. **One opening line** that captures the shape of the week. No heading.
2. **## Looking back** — 2-3 paragraphs synthesizing what happened. Pull from the data. Cite specifics. If meetings or files came up that connect to a goal or theme, surface that.
3. **## Patterns I noticed** — 1-2 paragraphs of cross-signal observations. Or "Nothing stood out across signals this week."
4. **## Open threads** — bullet list (3-5 items) of things mentioned but not resolved. Pull from lingering tasks, unanswered journal questions, knowledge gaps, pending drafts.
5. **## One thing for next week** — a single specific suggestion with the rationale for why this and not something else.

If a prior letter is provided, reference it ONCE if relevant (e.g., "last week you mentioned X — looks like it Y'd"). Don't force it.
