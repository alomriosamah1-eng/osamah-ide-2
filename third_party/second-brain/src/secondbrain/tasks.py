"""Phase 47: tasks as first-class.

Action items in transcripts have been rendered into doc bodies since
Phase 43 (Granola action-items extraction). The daily brief grepped
`- [ ]` checkboxes off chunks. Both work — until you actually want to
*do* one of them. Then you need:

  - Persistent identity (so finishing one removes it from tomorrow's
    brief instead of getting re-extracted)
  - A way to mark complete (`tasks done <id>`)
  - A place to add ad-hoc tasks ("remind me to email Sarah") that
    didn't come from a transcript
  - Eventually, two-way sync with Apple Reminders / Todoist

This module owns the data model and the extraction. Sync stubs live
adjacent (`tasks_apple.py` / `tasks_todoist.py`) — kept as future work
unless the user asks. For now: local source of truth, with the
dataclass shape ready for later sync.

Extraction recognises two patterns in transcript-shaped docs:

  A. ``## Action items`` heading → bullet list (plain ``- text`` or
     checkbox ``- [ ] text``). Used by the IMAP transcript renderer
     since Phase 43.
  B. Bare ``- [ ] text`` checkboxes anywhere in the doc. Used by
     manual notes that include todos.

Closed checkboxes (``- [x]`` / ``- [X]``) are skipped — already done.

Materialisation is idempotent: ``materialize_from_transcripts`` reads
recent transcript chunks and INSERT-OR-IGNOREs into ``tasks``. The
UNIQUE on ``(text_lower, source_path)`` means re-running it is free.
The daily brief calls this before reading open tasks, so newly-ingested
transcripts surface their action items the next time you check in.
