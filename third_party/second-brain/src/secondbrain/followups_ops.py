"""Round 20 (Phase EA-1+) — followups operations layer.

Extends the round-19 ``followups`` module with the lifecycle ops a
real EA would do daily:

  - **Auto-resolution**: scan recently-sent emails / journal mentions
    and mark matching open *outgoing* followups resolved. (Telltale:
    "I just sent the deck" → mark "Send Sarah the deck" resolved.)
  - **Snooze**: defer an open followup until a future date. Snoozed
    items stay status='open' but get hidden from the default view
    until ``snooze_until`` passes.
  - **Edit**: the user can override topic / description / due_at /
    person assignment after the fact.
  - **Bulk dismiss**: clear all open followups for one person, or all
    overdue, or all of one direction.
  - **Auto-nudge**: for stale *incoming* followups (where the other
    party still owes the user something), draft a polite "checking
    in on this" email in the user's voice profile.
  - **Per-person view**: list everything pending with one person.
  - **History**: closed/resolved followups + how long they took.

Design: this is purely an extensions module — keeps the round-19
``followups.py`` lean (extraction + storage) while putting all
operational logic here. The dashboard / MCP / daemon layer all call
through this module.

_NUDGE_SYSTEM = """\
You draft polite, brief "checking in" emails for the user. The user
made a request to someone weeks ago that hasn't been addressed yet,
and they want to nudge without being pushy.

You receive:
  - The original commitment topic + description.
  - Days since they asked.
  - Optional: the user's voice profile (greeting, sign-off, contraction
    rate, typical phrasing).

You return a JSON object:
  subject: 4-8 word subject line, optionally starting with "Re: "
           if it's a continuation of an earlier thread.
  body: 2-4 sentence email body in the user's voice. Plain text,
        no greeting/sign-off (the user appends those). Tone:
        warm-but-direct. Acknowledge that life happens. Make it easy
        to reply.

Rules:
  - No "I just wanted to follow up", no "sorry to bother you", no
    "I know you're busy" — these are anti-patterns the user dislikes.
  - Don't re-state the entire request; reference it briefly.
  - Don't include emoji or exclamation marks.
  - Return ONLY the JSON object.
