"""Phase 67 + 68: spaced repetition + knowledge gap detection.

You're already capturing every class lecture via Plaud → transcript
ingest → docs with `[course]` titles. Right now that's a search
corpus. This module turns it into a study system.

Two halves:

  1. **Card generation** — for each `[course]` doc, generate a small
     batch of conceptual Q&A flashcards via Claude Haiku. Cards persist
     to ``study_cards`` so re-runs don't regenerate. Idempotent via
     UNIQUE(file_id, question).

  2. **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — each card carries ease + interval +
     next_due_at. The CLI quiz session asks due cards, the user grades
     0-5, and the schedule updates per the SM-2 algorithm. Weak cards
     bubble up to next session; well-known cards retire to weekly /
     monthly review.

Phase 68 piggybacks: when ``ask_brain`` returns weak results (top
retrieval score below threshold OR fewer than N hits), the question
lands in ``knowledge_gaps``. The weekly review (Phase 72) surfaces
top gaps as study targets.

Cost guard: card generation is bounded per-doc (default 5 cards) and
per-tick (default 3 docs). One full course's worth of lectures
materialises over a week of background runs, not all at once.
