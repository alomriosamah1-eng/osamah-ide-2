"""Phase 52: auto-backlinks between docs — the Obsidian-style brain.

Search finds what you're looking for; backlinks find what you weren't.
After a doc lands in the index, we compute its top-K most-similar
existing docs by chunk-embedding nearness, and store the pairs in
``backlinks``. The ``/file/<path>`` dashboard view + a CLI command
surface them as "see also" context.

Why this matters more than search:

- You search when you have a question. Backlinks fire passively while
  you're already reading a doc — "here's the related stuff you forgot
  you wrote".
- They turn the index from a query box into something you wander.
- They're symmetric: linking new → old also lets old → new, so
  re-reading an ancient note surfaces today's fresh context.

How it works:

1. After ``replace_chunks`` finishes for a file (indexer + connector
   syncs both go through there), ``link_doc`` runs.
2. Pull every chunk-embedding for that file. Use each as a query
   against ``vec_chunks`` to fetch the K nearest *other-file* chunks.
3. Aggregate by destination ``file_id``: keep the BEST (lowest
   distance) match per candidate file. This is more robust than
   averaging — a long doc has many chunks, and the strongest match is
   what makes the link feel right.
4. Take the top K by distance, threshold-filter, and store both
   directions (src → dst AND dst → src) so retrieval is one-sided.

Cost: one vec query per chunk on the new doc. For a typical 5-chunk
doc that's 5 sub-millisecond queries. For a giant 200-chunk PDF we
cap the chunk fan-out so the cost stays bounded.

Bulk recompute is supported via ``rebuild_all`` for migrating an
existing brain forward.
