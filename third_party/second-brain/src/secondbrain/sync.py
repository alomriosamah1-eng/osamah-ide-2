"""Phase 62: parallel connector sync — fan out fetches, serialise writes.

Before this module, ``secondbrain sync all`` ran connectors strictly
sequentially: GitHub → Notion → Gmail → Drive → ... Each connector
spent most of its wall-clock time blocked on the network. With N
connectors averaging ~5s of latency each, 10 connectors took ~50s
even though they don't share any state.

This module runs the network-bound part (``connector.fetch()``) in a
thread pool with bounded queueing. A single consumer thread pulls
``(connector, doc)`` items off the queue and runs the indexer write
path — that part stays serial because:

1. The Voyage embedder has its own rate limits + batching that
   benefits from a single caller's view of the work.
2. SQLite serialises writers anyway; concurrent indexer threads
   would just contend for the writer lock + foreign-key constraints
   on the chunks table.
3. The entity extractor (spaCy) holds GIL-bound CPU; running N of
   those in parallel doesn't help on a Python build with GIL.

The win is purely on the *fetch* leg: 10 connectors that each spend
~5s waiting for their respective APIs now overlap instead of
serialising. Bound the worker count so we don't fork-bomb the user's
machine — defaults to 8 which is enough for the usual 10-15
configured connectors.

Callers (CLI ``sync`` + MCP ``sync_source``) get the same per-connector
counts dict they had before, so the calling code didn't need a
restructure — only the orchestrator did.
