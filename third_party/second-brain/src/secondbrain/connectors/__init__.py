"""Connectors pull data from cloud sources (GitHub, Notion, Calendar, etc.)
into the same pipeline used for filesystem ingest.

Each connector implements a small protocol: name, is_enabled(cfg), and
fetch(cfg) yielding ConnectorDocument objects. The CLI `secondbrain sync`
command runs them through ``index_text`` so the resulting docs become
searchable, entity-extracted, and dedup'd alongside everything else.

Connectors are opt-in via env vars (GITHUB_TOKEN, NOTION_TOKEN, etc.) so
adding a new source is just exporting a token. No OAuth dance required for
these — Gmail / Google Drive will live in a separate module that handles
the OAuth flow.
